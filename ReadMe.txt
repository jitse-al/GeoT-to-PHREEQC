The following scripts are written in the software FreeMat (Basu, 2011), available at http://freemat.sourceforge.net/. FreeMat is openly available software and is needed to run the code.
The main file needed for the code is: GeoT_to_PHREEQC.m

To run the software, follow the following steps.
- Install FreeMat
- Copy all .m files to the necessary FreeMat folder, which can be found at C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Freemat
- Open Freemat
- Enter the command: 
   edit: GeoT_to_PHREEQC
- Enter the path/filename of the database you want to convert
- Press Run/F5

Converted files will be found in the same folder as the inputfile

*Please note: depending on the inputfile, the outputfile may not work directly in PHREEQC, and some manual adaptations may need to be in place. For more information, see Alsemgeest & Auque, Conversion, verification and geothermal comparison of the databases SOLTHERM and Yucca Mountain Project, Geothermics (submitted February, 2020)
